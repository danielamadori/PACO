# Project Analysis and Fix

## Analysis
- [x] Read documentation ([README.md](file:///c:/Users/Emanuele/GithubRepo/PACO/README.md), `docs/*.md`)
- [x] Read notebooks ([tutorial.ipynb](file:///c:/Users/Emanuele/GithubRepo/PACO/tutorial.ipynb))
- [x] Run application to check status
    - [x] GUI running at `http://127.0.0.1:8050`
    - [x] Simulator crashing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pm4py.util'`
- [x] Analyze Dash layout and dependencies (`_dash-dependencies`)
- [ ] Create Callback DAG (`callback_graph.md`)
- [x] Diff iterations (stable vs latest)
    - [x] Identified changed files in `gui` and `src`
- [ ] Test GUI (Blocked by browser tool environment issue)

## Fixes
- [ ] Fix `pm4py` dependency issue
    - `pm4py` version `2.7.x` seems required but installation of `2.7.19.7` failed/is incomplete.
- [ ] Verify Simulator after fix
- [ ] Ensure callbacks are stable after fix
