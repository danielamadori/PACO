# Project Analysis and Fix

## Analysis
- [x] Read documentation ([README.md](file:///c:/Users/Emanuele/GithubRepo/PACO/README.md), `docs/*.md`)
- [x] Read notebooks ([tutorial.ipynb](file:///c:/Users/Emanuele/GithubRepo/PACO/tutorial.ipynb))
- [x] Run application to check status
    - [x] GUI running at `http://127.0.0.1:8050`
    - [x] Simulator crashing with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pm4py.util'`
- [x] Analyze Dash layout and dependencies (`_dash-dependencies`)
- [x] Create Callback DAG ([callback_graph.md](file:///C:/Users/Emanuele/.gemini/antigravity/brain/0791679f-94dd-49fa-a8ad-98655ecadb8f/callback_graph.md))
- [x] Analyze DAG for issues ([analyze_dag.py](file:///c:/Users/Emanuele/GithubRepo/PACO/analyze_dag.py))
- [x] Diff iterations (stable vs latest)
    - [x] Identified changed files in `gui` and `src`
- [ ] Test GUI (Blocked by browser tool environment issue)

## Fixes
- [ ] Fix `pm4py` dependency issue
    - `pm4py` version `2.7.x` seems required.
    - [ ] `pip install --force-reinstall` FAILED (system permissions).
    - [ ] Manual copy FAILED (workspace restriction).
- [ ] Verify Simulator after fix (Blocked by `pm4py` issue)
- [ ] Ensure callbacks are stable after fix (Blocked by browser tool issue)

## Known Issues
1. **Critical:** `pm4py` installation is broken/incompatible. Needs manual user intervention or virtual environment fix.
2. **Environment:** Browser tool not working (`$HOME` not set).
3. **App Logic:** Potential circular dependency in Callback 12 and "God Callbacks" identified in [callback_graph.md](file:///C:/Users/Emanuele/.gemini/antigravity/brain/0791679f-94dd-49fa-a8ad-98655ecadb8f/callback_graph.md).
