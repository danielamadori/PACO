[2026-02-09 18:21:58,094] - [GUI] If the vessel is not designated as priority (which happens 85% of the times), it goes into a vessel lying phase where it waits at anchor or in a holding area. This lying period can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours, costs around \$200 in harbor fees and fuel, and consumes minimal energy at about 10 kWh. Following this waiting period, we proceed with the standard container unloading operation, which takes between 2 to 4 hours, costs approximately \$800, and uses 150 kWh of energy to operate the cranes and handling equipment.
