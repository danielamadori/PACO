# BPMN+CPI Process Design Template

## Overview

This template helps you design complex business processes using **BPMN+CPI** (Business Process Model and Notation with Choice, Probability, and Impact). Use this template to systematically define your process structure, tasks, decision points, and resource impacts.

## 0. LLM Instruction: How to Parse Natural Language Descriptions

**When a user provides a high-level process description, systematically extract the following:**

### Step 1: Identify All Tasks

Look for action words, activities, or work items:

- Keywords: "do", "execute", "perform", "make", "create", "check", "process", "handle"
- Examples: "cutting material", "quality check", "send invoice", "pack items"
- Extract: Task names (use descriptive names from user's language)

### Step 2: Identify Flow Patterns

Determine how tasks relate to each other:

**Sequential**: Look for temporal indicators

- Keywords: "then", "after", "followed by", "next", "before", "first", "finally"
- Pattern: `Task1, Task2, Task3`
- Example: "First cut, then drill" → `Cutting, Drilling`

**Parallel**: Look for simultaneity indicators

- Keywords: "simultaneously", "at the same time", "both", "in parallel", "together", "all at once"
- Pattern: `(Task1 || Task2 || Task3)`
- Example: "Both quality check and documentation happen together" → `(QualityCheck || Documentation)`

**Choice** (Strategic Decision): Look for decision points under your control

- Keywords: "choose", "decide", "option", "select", "either...or", "alternative"
- Pattern: `(TaskA /[C#] TaskB)`
- Example: "We can choose between fast expensive method or slow cheap method" → `(FastExpensive /[C1] SlowCheap)`

**Nature** (Probabilistic): Look for uncertain outcomes beyond control

- Keywords: "might", "probability", "chance", "sometimes", "if it fails", "randomly", "based on conditions"
- Pattern: `(TaskA ^[N#] TaskB)`
- Example: "80% chance of passing quality check, 20% failure" → `(Pass ^[N1] Fail)` with probability 0.8

**Loop**: Look for repetition with exit conditions

- Keywords: "repeat", "retry", "until", "keep doing", "loop"
- Pattern: `<[L#] TaskBody>`
- Example: "Retry connection until successful" → `<[L1] RetryConnection>`

### Step 3: Extract Task Details

**For each identified task, extract:**

**Impacts**: Look for resource consumption

- Keywords: "costs", "takes time", "uses energy", "requires workers", "emissions", "consumes"
- Numbers with units: "$50", "2 hours", "10 kWh", "3 worker-hours"
- Default: If not specified, use 0.0 for each impact category

**Durations**: Look for time windows

- Keywords: "takes between X and Y time", "minimum duration", "maximum duration", "can take up to"
- Pattern: `[min, max]`
- Example: "takes 1 to 5 hours" → `[1, 5]`
- Default: `[0, 1]` for instant tasks, `[1, 100]` for undefined durations

### Step 4: Extract Gateway Details

**For Choices**, extract:

- Delay: "takes X time to decide", "decision delay"
- Default: 0 if not specified

**For Natures**, extract:

- Probability: "X% chance", "probability of X", "happens with probability X"
- Convert to 0-1 range: 80% → 0.8
- Default: 0.5 (50/50) if not specified

**For Loops**, extract: (but its not yet supported)

- Exit probability: "X% chance to exit", "succeeds with probability X"
- Max rounds: "try up to N times", "maximum N iterations"
- Defaults: exit_probability=0.3, max_rounds=10

### Step 5: Identify Impact Categories

Look for types of resources mentioned:

- **Cost**: "$", "dollars", "budget", "expense", "price"
- **Time**: "hours", "minutes", "days", "duration"
- **Energy**: "kWh", "electricity", "power consumption"
- **Emissions**: "CO2", "carbon", "emissions", "pollution"
- **Workers**: "staff", "employees", "person-hours", "labor"

If user mentions specific impacts, use those names. Otherwise, default to ["cost", "time"].

### Step 6: Build the Expression

Follow operator precedence and nesting rules:

1. Group parallel sections in parentheses: `((A || B), C)`
2. Group choice/nature branches in parentheses: `(A /[C1] (B, C))`
3. Sequential has lowest precedence: just comma-separate
4. Ensure SESE: single entry, single exit (except for gateways)

### Step 7: Validation Before Output

Before generating the final dictionary, check:

- ✓ All tasks in expression exist in impacts dict
- ✓ All tasks in expression exist in durations dict
- ✓ All choice IDs [C#] exist in delays dict
- ✓ All nature IDs [N#] exist in probabilities dict
- ✓ All loop IDs [L#] exist in loop_probability and loop_round dicts
- ✓ All impact values are ≥ 0
- ✓ All durations are [min, max] with min ≤ max
- ✓ All probabilities are between 0 and 1
- ✓ Expression syntax is valid (balanced parentheses)

### Examples of Parsing

**User Input:** "First we cut the material, then we can choose between polishing or painting, finally we ship"

**Parsing Steps:**

1. Tasks: Cutting, Polishing, Painting, Shipping
2. Flow: Sequential → Choice → Sequential
3. Expression: `Cutting, (Polishing /[C1] Painting), Shipping`
4. Choice C1: no delay specified → delay = 0
5. Impacts: not specified → default to 0.0
6. Durations: not specified → use [0, 1]

**User Input:** "We do quality check and documentation in parallel. There's 90% chance QC passes, otherwise we rework"

**Parsing Steps:**

1. Tasks: QualityCheck, Documentation, Pass, Rework
2. Flow: Parallel (QC, Doc) then Nature (Pass vs Rework)
3. Expression: `(QualityCheck || Documentation), (Pass ^[N1] Rework)`
4. Nature N1: 90% chance → probability = 0.9
5. Continue parsing for impacts and durations...

## 1. Process Information

### Process Name

**Name:** _[e.g., Manufacturing Workflow, Order Processing, etc.]_

### Process Description

_Provide a high-level description of what this process accomplishes:_

```
[Describe the overall goal and flow of your process]
```

### Impact Categories

_Define what resources or metrics you want to track (e.g., cost, time, energy, CO2 emissions, worker hours):_

## 2. Expression Definition

### Process Expression

The expression defines the control flow structure using BPMN+CPI syntax.

**Syntax Guide:**

- `,` = Sequential execution (A then B)
- `||` = Parallel execution (A and B simultaneously)
- `/[C#]` = Choice gateway (strategic decision between alternatives)
- `^[N#]` = Nature gateway (probabilistic branching)
- `@[L#]` = Loop with probabilistic exit
- `()` = Grouping operations

**Your Expression:**

```
expression = ""
```

**Expression Explanation:**
_Describe the flow in natural language:_

```
[Example: "First we execute Cutting, then in parallel we do (Bending followed by 
a nature split between HighPrecision and LowPrecision) alongside (Milling followed 
by a choice between FastDrill and RegularDrill), finally we make a choice between 
HighPowerHighSpeed and LowPowerLowSpeed finishing"]
```

## 10. Expected Outcomes

### Strategy Synthesis Goal

_What strategic decisions are you trying to optimize?_

```
[Example: "Find a strategy that minimizes expected cost while staying under 
the 40-hour time budget and handling probabilistic quality variations"]
```

### Key Questions

1. **Is there a feasible strategy?** _Can we complete the process within bounds?_
2. **What choices should we make?** _Which decisions at each choice point?_
3. **Expected impacts?** _What are the anticipated resource consumptions?_
4. **Guaranteed bounds?** _What are the worst-case scenarios?_

### Success Criteria

_How will you know if the synthesized strategy is good enough?_

```
[Define thresholds or acceptance criteria]
```

---

## 11. Process Visualization

After defining your BPMN+CPI, you can visualize:

1. **BPMN Diagram:** Shows tasks, gateways, and flow
2. **Parse Tree (Region Tree):** Hierarchical structure
3. **Execution Tree:** All possible execution paths
4. **Strategy Explanation:** Labeled choices showing decisions

_[Insert or reference generated visualizations here]_

## Appendix: Quick Reference

### Expression Operators

| Operator  | Meaning    | Example         | Description                            |
| --------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `,`     | Sequential | `A, B`        | Execute A then B                       |
| `\|\|`    | Parallel   | `A \|\| B`      | Execute A and B concurrently           |
| `/[C#]` | Choice     | `A /[C1] B`   | Strategic choice between A or B        |
| `^[N#]` | Nature     | `A ^[N1] B`   | Probabilistic branch: A (p) or B (1-p) |
| `@[L#]` | Loop       | `A @[L1]`     | Repeat A with probabilistic exit       |
| `()`    | Grouping   | `(A, B) \|\| C` | Group operations for precedence        |

### Common Patterns

#### Sequential Tasks

```
"T1, T2, T3"  → Execute T1, then T2, then T3
```

#### Parallel Tasks

```
"T1 || T2 || T3"  → Execute all three simultaneously
```

#### Choice with Fallback

```
"(ExpensiveFast /[C1] CheapSlow)"  → Strategic decision
```

#### Nature with Contingency

```
"(Success ^[N1] Failure), Recovery"  → Handle probabilistic outcome
```

#### Complex Manufacturing Flow

```
"Prep, ((QualityCheck, (HighPrec ^[N1] LowPrec)) || (Cutting, (Fast /[C1] Slow))), Finish"
```
